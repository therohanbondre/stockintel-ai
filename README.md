## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1 — Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RohanBondre/StockIntel-AI.git
cd StockIntel-AI
```

### 2 — Create & activate a virtual environment
```bash

## 🕹️ How to Use

1. **Select Market** — choose *Indian* or *US* from the sidebar.
2. **Pick a Stock** — select any ticker from the dropdown (200+ symbols).
3. **Set Forecast Horizon** — drag the slider (1–30 days).
4. **Toggle Overlays** — enable RSI, SMA, EMA, or Bollinger Bands.
5. **Click ⚡ Run Forecast** — the app:
   - Fetches live OHLCV data from Yahoo Finance
   - Computes technical indicators
   - Runs the LSTM for N-day forecasts
   - Renders a candlestick chart with colour-coded prediction segments  
     (🟢 green = up, 🔴 red = down)
   - Shows a Day-by-Day Forecast Summary panel on the right
6. **Show Raw OHLCV Data** — checkbox to view the underlying dataframe.
7. **About Tab** — methodology, credits, and legal disclaimer.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

```
Input  (60 trading days)
    →  LSTM(50, return_sequences=True)
    →  Dropout(0.2)
    →  LSTM(50, return_sequences=False)
    →  Dropout(0.2)
    →  Dense(25)
    →  Dense(1)   ← Predicted next-day close price (scaled 0–1)
```

- **Sequence length**: 60 trading days
- **Loss function**: Mean Squared Error
- **Optimiser**: Adam
- **Retraining**: `test_pipeline.py` — fetches 5 years of data, trains, saves `lstm_model.h5`

## 🔧 Technical Indicators

| Indicator | Period | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| RSI | 14 | Relative Strength Index — momentum oscillator |
| SMA20 / SMA50 | 20 / 50 | Simple Moving Averages — trend direction |
| EMA20 | 20 | Exponential Moving Average — faster trend signal |
| BB_upper / BB_lower | 20 ± 2σ | Bollinger Bands — volatility envelope |

All indicators are computed in `utils/preprocess.py` and are individually
toggled on/off from the sidebar.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Smoke tests (script-style, print-based)
python test_data.py        # Verify data fetching returns correct columns/shape
python test_models.py      # Verify model builder loads without error
python test_pipeline.py    # Full retrain + save + predict (overwrites lstm_model.h5)
```

> **Note:** Proper `pytest` test suites with assertions and mocking are planned
> for Phase 7 of the roadmap.
